        <p>Welcome to our Red Team presentation.<br><br><br><br>A Red Team exercise is not a drill. It’s a full-scope cybersecurity assessment designed to test an organization’s true defensive readiness. <br><br>Unlike traditional audits or tabletop scenarios, Red Team operations simulate real-world adversaries — using the same tactics, techniques, <br><br>and procedures as professional cybercriminals. These engagements are stealthy, persistent, and goal-driven — just like the real thing.<br><br><br><br>Our objective is not to check boxes or generate reports — it's to reveal blind spots. <br><br>We test not just your technology, but your people, your processes, and your ability to detect and respond under pressure.<br><br><br><br>What you're about to see are controlled demonstrations of how fast, quiet, and damaging a modern cyberattack can be — <br><br>executed against systems that appear secure on the surface. This is the frontline of digital defense — and we're here to show you what it really looks like.</p>

            These are not simulations or staged attacks — these are real-world demonstrations using the same Tier-1 techniques 
            professional adversaries deploy against healthcare networks daily. You will witness how swiftly and silently 
            a trusted hospital device can be compromised.

                    <strong>Man-in-the-Middle</strong><br>
                    An attacker sends a convincing email with a fake login link. When the user signs in, full access to the email account is captured.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <strong>Direct Exploit</strong><br>
                    While on public Wi-Fi, the device is silently compromised. The attacker gains complete control—no alerts, no authentication required.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <strong>Poisoned URL</strong><br>
                    A trusted-looking link leads to a malicious site. Simply visiting it is enough to trigger infection—no downloads necessary.
